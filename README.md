# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard is an established technology that is looking for business continuity strategies to address a projected increase in retirements in key positions. Pewlett-Hackard believes that it can set up a mentorship program which will pair prospective retirees with a junior employee. The goal of the program will be to lessen the impact of the reirements by passing knowledge to the next generation before they leave.

## Conclusions

Pewlett-Hackard (PH) has a large numnber of employees leaving the organization over a four year period. The number of employees that PH has identified for the mentorship program is not sufficient to backfill all the key roles. This means that PH needs to consider otherways to backfill the potential vacancies. The following are the key takeaways from the analysis:

  1. The company currently has 300,024 employees, it's projected that 90,398 employees will retire (or 30% of PH workforce).
  2. PH has identified 550 employees to be part of its mentorship program. This is less than 1% of the forecasted retirements.
